Installation Guide:

REQUIREMENTS:

1. python 2.6+

BASIC TOOLS

1. "install python setuptools"

2. ~$: easy_install pip

3. ~$: pip install virtualenv

4. We are going to install a virtual environment for the project instance. Find
   a place to put your VE, it doesn't matter where you put it:

   ~$: virtualenv <path-to-new-virtualenv-directory>

   The requirements file is located at the project root as "requirements.pip"

   ~$: pip install --upgrade -E <virtualenv dir> --requirement <requirements file>

   The dependencies for the project should install now, make sure to the header
   files for MySQL are available on your system, the client needs to be compiled
   from source during the installation process.

   OSX: on osx with XCode 4 installed building the mysql bindings might fail
   with error code 1 on the gcc. In that case it might be due to the fact that
   arch flags are deprecated with XCode 4.

   Try:

   ~$: export ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'

   UPDATE: This problem no longer exists for OSX 10.7 Lion

5. Install the dasdocc app from the dassdoc root-folder:

  ~$: pip install -e .

6. Now activate the virtual environment via:

   ~$: source <virtualenv dir>/bin/activate

   (the VE can now be deactivated any time with "~$: deactivate")


PROJECT BOOTSTRAP

1. In development mode, each settings can be overwritten by placing the file
  "settings_local.py" right next to "settings.py" in the dasdocc source folder

2. If you installed the MySQL dependency from requirements.pip and have a user
   called "root" without password, you should not need to modify any settings

3. setup the databases with:

   ~$: python manage.py syncdb

   and run the migrations:

   ~$: python manage.py migrate

4. to make sure everything is fine, run:

   ~$: python manage.py test aggregator

   All tests must pass in order to have the app working

5. start the development server with:

   ~$: python manage.py runserver

6. urls currently working are "/", "/admin/" and "/playground/"
