1. Entries without publishing date are duplicated on each feed update / models.Feed#update
   > this happens because the date is a required field for an entry and it is defaulted to datetime.now() if not present
   > dates have to be left out on duplication checking, but this may lead to false positives

2. Entries deleted from the database once enter it again on the next update cycle / helpers.feed_helpers.Feedparser
   > entries should not be saved, when they would be expired right afterwards
