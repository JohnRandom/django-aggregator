1. Entries without publishing date are duplicated on each feed update / models.Feed#update
   > this happens because the date is a required field for an entry and it is defaulted to datetime.now() if not present
   > dates have to be left out on duplication checking, but this may lead to false positives

2. StaticContent pulled from other pages may contain nodes with an ID property, which potentially leads to multiple nodes with the same ID on the landing page
   > lxml should convert each ID found to a class
